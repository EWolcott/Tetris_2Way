# Tetris_2Way
 A dart/flutter mobile app of tetris with a twist 

This was a group project, and I developed designs, many of which were unfortunately scrapped just before submission, as well as the idea to store the widget grids in a 2d-array that constantly checks itself. The designs were abandoned to let alternating themes work properly, a property of the shared preferences plugin that I helped code into the game. This way a player could change their aesthetic preferences and maintain the setting when the game was reloaded.
